# Architecture-Design-DataSources
In this repository i've gathered multiple data sources for experiments on architecture and design using image processing such as GANs or CNNs and many other techniques
Feel Free to send more DataSources (Makesure it's open sourced and link is not broken)

Data is like ingredients to machine learning models, algorithms are like the pan you're preparing it, and GPUs would be the fire!
Pick up the right ones and make your own recipe
